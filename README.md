# Chatbot with LLM (OpenAI) and Streamlit

This repository contains the code for the Chatbot build with LLM (OpenAI) and Streamlit, which allows users to interact with the powerful language model provided by OpenAI.

# Usage

To get started, enter your OpenAI API key in the sidebar, and then type a message in the chat box below. To obtain an OpenAI API key, follow these steps:

- Go to the OpenAI website.
- Click on the 'Sign up' button in the top right corner of the page.
- Fill out the sign-up form with your information and click on the 'Create account' button.
- Once your account is created, log in and go to the API keys page.
- Click on the 'Create new API key' button and follow the instructions to create a new API key.

To use the app, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the app's URL in your web browser: https://chatbot-llm-openai.streamlit.app/
- Once the app loads, you will see a text input field labeled "Your message".
- Type your message or question in the text input field. The language model will respond based on the input provided.
- Click "Enter" button to submit your query and generate a response from the language model.

The app will use the powerful GPT-3.5 language model by OpenAI to process your input and provide a corresponding response.

# Limitations

Please be aware of the following limitations:

- This app is a demonstration of the capabilities of the GPT-3.5 language model and may not cover all possible use cases.
- As this is a prototype built on Streamlit, the app's performance may be affected by memory limitations (1 GB). Consequently, it may not be able to handle very large amounts of data or extremely complex queries.
- The app's functionality relies on an OpenAI API key. To use the LangChain and other language processing features, you need to enter your OpenAI API key in the app's text field labeled "OpenAI API Key".

Please ensure you have a stable internet connection while using the app, as it requires internet access to communicate with the OpenAI servers.

# Disclaimer

This application is meant for educational and experimental purposes only. The responses generated by the language model may not always be accurate or suitable for specific use cases. Users are advised to verify the information provided by the model for critical applications.
